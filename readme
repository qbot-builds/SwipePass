# Swipe Pass

## Windows

Just need to download the windows zip file, extract into a folder and run the main program.
When a new update is released, it should be detected and auto-updated by program. But if u find any problem you can run updater.exe manually

## MacOs

Download ZIP file depending of your architecture

ARM if M1/M2 processor
AMD64 if you have other intel processor

You need to create a folder and unzip the zip file.

Then we need to open a terminal and run this commands:

Replace <file_name> with the file of SwipePass

- `chmod +x <file_name>`
- `chmod +x updater`

Finally you can run the program.

- `./<file_name>`
